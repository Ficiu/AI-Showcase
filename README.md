# AI Showcase
This repository is intended to show the code I have created for Supreme Engine, a custom 3D Engine dedicated to the creation of Real-Time Strategy games. 

It is not provided in a state where it will run, as the repository holds only my part of the projects, however it is the best and most extensive show of my skill. Supreme Engine was built over a period of 4 months by 11 programmers.
